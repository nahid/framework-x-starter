     *         // an error occured while trying to connect or authorize client
     *     }
     * );
     * ```
     *
     * The method returns a [Promise](https://github.com/reactphp/promise) that
     * will resolve with a [`ConnectionInterface`](#connectioninterface)
     * instance on success or will reject with an `Exception` if the URL is
     * invalid or the connection or authentication fails.
     *
     * The returned Promise is implemented in such a way that it can be
     * cancelled when it is still pending. Cancelling a pending promise will
     * reject its value with an Exception and will cancel the underlying TCP/IP
     * connection attempt and/or MySQL authentication.
     *
     * ```php
     * $promise = $factory->createConnection($url);
     *
     * Loop::addTimer(3.0, function () use ($promise) {
     *     $promise->cancel();
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * The `$url` parameter must contain the database host, optional
     * authentication, port and database to connect to:
     *
     * ```php
     * $factory->createConnection('user:secret@localhost:3306/database');
     * ```
     *
     * Note that both the username and password must be URL-encoded (percent-encoded)
     * if they contain special characters:
     *
     * ```php
     * $user = 'he:llo';
     * $pass = 'p@ss';
     *
     * $promise = $factory->createConnection(
     *     rawurlencode($user) . ':' . rawurlencode($pass) . '@localhost:3306/db'
     * );
     * ```
     *
     * You can omit the port if you're connecting to default port `3306`:
     *
     * ```php
     * $factory->createConnection('user:secret@localhost/database');
     * ```
     *
     * If you do not include authentication and/or database, then this method
     * will default to trying to connect as user `root` with an empty password
     * and no database selected. This may be useful when initially setting up a
     * database, but likely to yield an authentication error in a production system:
     *
     * ```php
     * $factory->createConnection('localhost');
     * ```
     *
     * This method respects PHP's `default_socket_timeout` setting (default 60s)
     * as a timeout for establishing the connection and waiting for successful
     * authentication. You can explicitly pass a custom timeout value in seconds
     * (or use a negative number to not apply a timeout) like this:
     *
     * ```php
     * $factory->createConnection('localhost?timeout=0.5');
     * ```
     *
     * By default, the connection uses the `utf8` charset encoding. Note that
     * MySQL's `utf8` encoding (also known as `utf8mb3`) predates what is now
     * known as UTF-8 and for historical reasons doesn't support emojis and
     * other characters. If you want full UTF-8 support, you can pass the
     * charset encoding like this:

     * Creates a new connection.
     *
     * It helps with establishing a TCP/IP connection to your MySQL database
     * and issuing the initial authentication handshake.
     *
     * ```php
     * $connection = $factory->createLazyConnection($url);
     *
     * $connection->query(…);
     * ```
     *
     * This method immediately returns a "virtual" connection implementing the
     * [`ConnectionInterface`](#connectioninterface) that can be used to
     * interface with your MySQL database. Internally, it lazily creates the
     * underlying database connection only on demand once the first request is
     * invoked on this instance and will queue all outstanding requests until
     * the underlying connection is ready. Additionally, it will only keep this
     * underlying connection in an "idle" state for 60s by default and will
     * automatically end the underlying connection when it is no longer needed.
     *
     * From a consumer side this means that you can start sending queries to the
     * database right away while the underlying connection may still be
     * outstanding. Because creating this underlying connection may take some
     * time, it will enqueue all oustanding commands and will ensure that all
     * commands will be executed in correct order once the connection is ready.
     * In other words, this "virtual" connection behaves just like a "real"
     * connection as described in the `ConnectionInterface` and frees you from
     * having to deal with its async resolution.
     *
     * If the underlying database connection fails, it will reject all
     * outstanding commands and will return to the initial "idle" state. This
     * means that you can keep sending additional commands at a later time which
     * will again try to open a new underlying connection. Note that this may
     * require special care if you're using transactions that are kept open for
     * longer than the idle period.
     *
     * Note that creating the underlying connection will be deferred until the
     * first request is invoked. Accordingly, any eventual connection issues
     * will be detected once this instance is first used. You can use the
     * `quit()` method to ensure that the "virtual" connection will be soft-closed
     * and no further commands can be enqueued. Similarly, calling `quit()` on
     * this instance when not currently connected will succeed immediately and
     * will not have to wait for an actual underlying connection.
     *
     * Depending on your particular use case, you may prefer this method or the
     * underlying `createConnection()` which resolves with a promise. For many
     * simple use cases it may be easier to create a lazy connection.
     *
     * The `$url` parameter must contain the database host, optional
     * authentication, port and database to connect to:
     *
     * ```php
     * $factory->createLazyConnection('user:secret@localhost:3306/database');
     * ```
     *
     * Note that both the username and password must be URL-encoded (percent-encoded)
     * if they contain special characters:
     *
     * ```php
     * $user = 'he:llo';
     * $pass = 'p@ss';
     *
     * $connection = $factory->createLazyConnection(
     *     rawurlencode($user) . ':' . rawurlencode($pass) . '@localhost:3306/db'
     * );
     * ```
     *
     * You can omit the port if you're connecting to default port `3306`:
     *
     * ```php
     * $factory->createLazyConnection('user:secret@localhost/database');

     * By default, this method will keep "idle" connection open for 60s and will
     * then end the underlying connection. The next request after an "idle"
     * connection ended will automatically create a new underlying connection.
     * This ensure you always get a "fresh" connection and as such should not be
     * confused with a "keepalive" or "heartbeat" mechanism, as this will not
     * actively try to probe the connection. You can explicitly pass a custom
     * idle timeout value in seconds (or use a negative number to not apply a
