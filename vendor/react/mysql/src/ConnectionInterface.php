/**
 * The `ConnectionInterface` represents a connection that is responsible for
 * communicating with your MySQL server instance, managing the connection state
 * and sending your database queries.
 *
 * Besides defining a few methods, this interface also implements the
 * `EventEmitterInterface` which allows you to react to certain events:
 *
 * error event:
 *     The `error` event will be emitted once a fatal error occurs, such as
 *     when the connection is lost or is invalid.
 *     The event receives a single `Exception` argument for the error instance.
 *
 *     ```php
 *     $connection->on('error', function (Exception $e) {
 *         echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
 *     });
 *     ```
 *
 *     This event will only be triggered for fatal errors and will be followed
 *     by closing the connection. It is not to be confused with "soft" errors
 *     caused by invalid SQL queries.
 *
 * close event:
 *     The `close` event will be emitted once the connection closes (terminates).
 *
 *     ```php
 *     $connection->on('close', function () {
 *         echo 'Connection closed' . PHP_EOL;
 *     });
 *     ```
 *
 *     See also the [`close()`](#close) method.

    /**
     * Performs an async query.
     *
     * This method returns a promise that will resolve with a `QueryResult` on
     * success or will reject with an `Exception` on error. The MySQL protocol
     * is inherently sequential, so that all queries will be performed in order
     * and outstanding queries will be put into a queue to be executed once the
     * previous queries are completed.
     *
     * ```php
     * $connection->query('CREATE TABLE test ...');
     * $connection->query('INSERT INTO test (id) VALUES (1)');
     * ```
     *
     * If this SQL statement returns a result set (such as from a `SELECT`
     * statement), this method will buffer everything in memory until the result
     * set is completed and will then resolve the resulting promise. This is
     * the preferred method if you know your result set to not exceed a few
     * dozens or hundreds of rows. If the size of your result set is either
     * unknown or known to be too large to fit into memory, you should use the
     * [`queryStream()`](#querystream) method instead.
     *
     * ```php
     * $connection->query($query)->then(function (QueryResult $command) {
     *     if (isset($command->resultRows)) {
     *         // this is a response to a SELECT etc. with some rows (0+)
     *         print_r($command->resultFields);
     *         print_r($command->resultRows);
     *         echo count($command->resultRows) . ' row(s) in set' . PHP_EOL;
     *     } else {
     *         // this is an OK message in response to an UPDATE etc.
     *         if ($command->insertId !== 0) {
     *             var_dump('last insert ID', $command->insertId);
     *         }
     *         echo 'Query OK, ' . $command->affectedRows . ' row(s) affected' . PHP_EOL;
     *     }
     * }, function (Exception $error) {
     *     // the query was not executed successfully
     *     echo 'Error: ' . $error->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * You can optionally pass an array of `$params` that will be bound to the
     * query like this:
     *
     * ```php
     * $connection->query('SELECT * FROM user WHERE id > ?', [$id]);
     * ```
     *
     * The given `$sql` parameter MUST contain a single statement. Support
     * for multiple statements is disabled for security reasons because it
     * could allow for possible SQL injection attacks and this API is not
     * suited for exposing multiple possible results.
     *
     * @param string $sql    SQL statement
     * @param array  $params Parameters which should be bound to query

     * Performs an async query and streams the rows of the result set.
     *
     * This method returns a readable stream that will emit each row of the
     * result set as a `data` event. It will only buffer data to complete a
     * single row in memory and will not store the whole result set. This allows
     * you to process result sets of unlimited size that would not otherwise fit
     * into memory. If you know your result set to not exceed a few dozens or
     * hundreds of rows, you may want to use the [`query()`](#query) method instead.
     *
     * ```php
     * $stream = $connection->queryStream('SELECT * FROM user');
     * $stream->on('data', function ($row) {

     * ```php
     * $stream = $connection->queryStream('SELECT * FROM user WHERE id > ?', [$id]);
     * ```
     *
     * This method is specifically designed for queries that return a result set
     * (such as from a `SELECT` or `EXPLAIN` statement). Queries that do not
     * return a result set (such as a `UPDATE` or `INSERT` statement) will not
     * emit any `data` events.
     *
     * See also [`ReadableStreamInterface`](https://github.com/reactphp/stream#readablestreaminterface)
     * for more details about how readable streams can be used in ReactPHP. For
     * example, you can also use its `pipe()` method to forward the result set
     * rows to a [`WritableStreamInterface`](https://github.com/reactphp/stream#writablestreaminterface)
     * like this:
     *
     * ```php
     * $connection->queryStream('SELECT * FROM user')->pipe($formatter)->pipe($logger);
     * ```
     *
     * Note that as per the underlying stream definition, calling `pause()` and
     * `resume()` on this stream is advisory-only, i.e. the stream MAY continue
     * emitting some data until the underlying network buffer is drained. Also
     * notice that the server side limits how long a connection is allowed to be
     * in a state that has outgoing data. Special care should be taken to ensure
     * the stream is resumed in time. This implies that using `pipe()` with a
     * slow destination stream may cause the connection to abort after a while.
     *
     * The given `$sql` parameter MUST contain a single statement. Support
