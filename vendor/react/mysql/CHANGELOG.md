    (#157 by @clue)

*   Feature / Fix: Improve protocol parser, emit parser errors and close invalid connections.
    (#158 and #159 by @clue)

    (#160 by @clue)

## 0.5.6 (2021-12-14)

*   Feature: Support optional `charset` parameter for full UTF-8 support (`utf8mb4`).
    (#135 by @clue)

    ```php

    (#141 by @clue and #138 by @SimonFrings)

    For most common use cases this means that simply reporting the `Exception`
    message should give the most relevant details for any connection issues:

    ```php
    $db->query($sql)->then(function (React\MySQL\QueryResult $result) {
        // …
    }, function (Exception $e) {
        echo 'Error:' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    });
    ```

*   Feature: Full support for PHP 8.1 release.
    (#150 by @clue)

*   Feature: Provide limited support for `NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` SQL mode.
    (#139 by @clue)

*   Update project dependencies, simplify socket usage, and improve documentation.
    (#136 and #137 by @SimonFrings)

*   Improve test suite and add `.gitattributes` to exclude dev files from exports.
    Run tests on PHPUnit 9 and PHP 8 and clean up test suite.
    (#142 and #143 by @SimonFrings)

    $factory = new React\MySQL\Factory($loop);

    // new (using default loop)
    $factory = new React\MySQL\Factory();
    ```

*   Improve test setup, use GitHub actions for continuous integration (CI) and fix minor typo.
    (#132 by @SimonFrings and #129 by @mmoreram)

## 0.5.0 (2018-11-28)

A major feature release with a significant API improvement!

This update does not involve any BC breaks, but we figured the new API provides
significant features that warrant a major version bump. Existing code will
continue to work without changes, but you're highly recommended to consider
using the new lazy connections as detailed below.

*   Feature: Add new `createLazyConnection()` method to only connect on demand and
    implement "idle" timeout to close underlying connection when unused.
    (#87 and #88 by @clue)

    ```php
    // new
    $connection = $factory->createLazyConnection($url);
    $connection->query(…);
    ```

    This method immediately returns a "virtual" connection implementing the
    [`ConnectionInterface`](README.md#connectioninterface) that can be used to
    interface with your MySQL database. Internally, it lazily creates the
    underlying database connection only on demand once the first request is
    invoked on this instance and will queue all outstanding requests until
    the underlying connection is ready. Additionally, it will only keep this
    underlying connection in an "idle" state for 60s by default and will
    automatically end the underlying connection when it is no longer needed.

    From a consumer side this means that you can start sending queries to the
    database right away while the underlying connection may still be
    outstanding. Because creating this underlying connection may take some
    time, it will enqueue all oustanding commands and will ensure that all
    commands will be executed in correct order once the connection is ready.
    In other words, this "virtual" connection behaves just like a "real"
    connection as described in the `ConnectionInterface` and frees you from
    having to deal with its async resolution.

*   Feature: Support connection timeouts.
    (#86 by @clue)

## 0.4.1 (2018-10-18)

*   Feature: Support cancellation of pending connection attempts.
    (#84 by @clue)

*   Feature: Add `warningCount` to `QueryResult`.
    (#82 by @legionth)

*   Feature: Add exception message for invalid MySQL URI.
    (#80 by @CharlotteDunois)

*   Fix: Fix parsing error message during handshake (Too many connections).
    (#83 by @clue)

## 0.4.0 (2018-09-21)

A major feature release with a significant documentation overhaul and long overdue API cleanup!

This update involves a number of BC breaks due to various changes to make the
API more consistent with the ReactPHP ecosystem. In particular, this now uses
promises consistently as return values instead of accepting callback functions
and this now offers an additional streaming API for processing very large result
sets efficiently.

We realize that the changes listed below may seem a bit overwhelming, but we've
tried to be very clear about any possible BC breaks. See below for changes you
have to take care of when updating from an older version.

*   Feature / BC break: Add Factory to simplify connecting and keeping connection state,
    mark `Connection` class as internal and remove `connect()` method.
    (#64 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old
    $connection = new Connection($loop, $options);
    $connection->connect(function (?Exception $error, $connection) {
        if ($error) {
            // an error occured while trying to connect or authorize client
        } else {
            // client connection established (and authenticated)
        }
    });

    // new
    $factory = new Factory($loop);
    $factory->createConnection($url)->then(
        function (ConnectionInterface $connection) {
            // client connection established (and authenticated)
        },
        function (Exception $e) {
            // an error occured while trying to connect or authorize client
        }
    );
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Use promises for `query()` method and resolve with `QueryResult` on success and
    and mark all commands as internal and move its base to Commands namespace.
    (#61 and #62 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old
    $connection->query('CREATE TABLE test');
    $connection->query('DELETE FROM user WHERE id < ?', $id);
    $connection->query('SELECT * FROM user', function (QueryCommand $command) {
        if ($command->hasError()) {
            echo 'Error: ' . $command->getError()->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
        } elseif (isset($command->resultRows)) {
            var_dump($command->resultRows);
        }
    });

    // new
    $connection->query('CREATE TABLE test');
    $connection->query('DELETE FROM user WHERE id < ?', [$id]);
    $connection->query('SELECT * FROM user')->then(function (QueryResult $result) {
        var_dump($result->resultRows);
    }, function (Exception $error) {
        echo 'Error: ' . $error->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    });
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Add new `queryStream()` method to stream result set rows and
    remove undocumented "results" event.
    (#57 and #77 by @clue)

    ```php
    $stream = $connection->queryStream('SELECT * FROM users');

    $stream->on('data', function ($row) {
        var_dump($row);
    });
    $stream->on('end', function () {
        echo 'DONE' . PHP_EOL;
    });
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Rename `close()` to `quit()`, use promises for `quit()` method and
    add new `close()` method to force-close the connection.
    (#65 and #76 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old: soft-close/quit
    $connection->close(function () {
        echo 'closed';
    });

    // new: soft-close/quit
    $connection->quit()->then(function () {
        echo 'closed';
    });

    // new: force-close
    $connection->close();
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Use promises for `ping()` method and resolve with void value on success.
    (#63 and #66 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old
    $connection->ping(function ($error, $connection) {
        if ($error) {
            echo 'Error: ' . $error->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
        } else {
            echo 'OK' . PHP_EOL;
        }
    });

    // new 
    $connection->ping(function () {
        echo 'OK' . PHP_EOL;
    }, function (Exception $error) {
        echo 'Error: ' . $error->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    });
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Define events on ConnectionInterface
    (#78 by @clue)

    `getOptions()`, `setOptions()` and `getServerOptions()`, `selectDb()` and `listFields()` dummy.
