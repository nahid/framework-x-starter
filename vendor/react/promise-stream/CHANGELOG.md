# Changelog

## 1.4.0 (2022-06-20)

*   Feature: Forward compatibility with react/promise 3.
    (#20 by @WyriHaximus)

## 1.3.0 (2021-10-18)

*   Feature: Improve error reporting by appending previous exception messages.
    (#26 by @clue)

    For most common use cases this means that simply reporting the `Exception`
    message should give the most relevant details for any issues:

    ```php
    React\Promise\Stream\buffer($stream)->then(function (string $contents) {
        // â€¦
    }, function (Exception $e) {
        echo 'Error:' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    });
    ```

*   Improve documentation, describe promise and stream data types.
    (#27 by @clue and #23 by @WyriHaximus)

*   Improve test suite and add `.gitattributes` to exclude dev files from exports.
    Use GitHub actions for continuous integration (CI) and run tests on PHPUnit 9 and PHP 8.
